What's something I know?
I know how to paint in different mediums, like watercolor, oil color, 
acrylics, a little pottery, and sculpture. I'm interested in expanding my art knowledge and skills now into technology-based creative modes and am learning coding. Hopefully if all goes well, I'll build my own website and sell my art and do some coding or website development on the side.
