Whats important to me?
 My family, I have three children (boys ages 12, 9 and 3), and every time I 
see my older son I realize that time's going so fast and it doesn't wait for you. My 
son is reaching my height, and already asking me "hey Dad do you have any 
t shirt that you wanna give me?", or every time I get a haircut the 
barber is like "hey man, it's like salt and pepper up there!", 
and it made me start to reflect on some of the fun things I remember that I have done with my family. 
I realized it is not enough and want to do more with them and for them, and so learning to code hopefully 
will help with managing my time, help me to feel fulfilled in my work, and to have the freedom and opportunities that I'm looking for.
