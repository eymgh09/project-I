Whats important to me ?
 My family, I have tree children, and every time I 
see my older son I realized that time go's and it doesn't wait for you, my 
son is reaching my hight, and already asking me "hey Dad do you have any 
t shirt that you wanna give it away?",or every-time I get a haircut the 
barber is like "hey men is like salt and pepper up there",and immediately it came's to me the tough "what are the fun things I remember that I have done with my family? And my unsure to that is "not enough", and so learning to code hopefully will help with managing my time, and have the freedom I'm looking for.
