Who am I?
My name is Elver Yarin, I am an artist, chef, graphic designer, and I have a passion for art and food. I am from the Peruvian highlands near Cuzco.
I moved to the USA after marrying my wife and graduated from the University of Fine Arts, and after my first son was born I began my culinary journey as a chef. My artistic knowledge helped me to work in high-end restaurants in New York City. My family lived in NYC for about 6 years but we decided to leave New York when we were expecting our third son and move to the countryside where we could start a farm and our kids could have space to play outside. I live in North Haven, Ct now and life is quiet, too quiet (except for my 3 year old son, he's loud an dcrazy). I have the space for an art studio, I put up a garden where we grow our food, we also builded a chicken coop, and we're also putting up an apple orchard, so life is good for now.
